# C → C++23 migration roadmap

This is the staging plan for migrating `codebase-memory-mcp` from C11 to
C++23. **Phase 1** (compile every first-party TU as C++23 with CMake) is
**done**, and the follow-on conversion of the files Phase 1 had left as C
is now **also done**: as of 2026-05-29 **every first-party translation unit
compiles as C++23** — `find src internal -name '*.c'` excluding vendored
libraries, the tree-sitter `grammar_*.c` parsers, and `ts_runtime.c`
returns nothing. **Phase 2** is the remaining idiomatic-C++23 rewriting
that turns ported-as-C++ TUs into modern code (RAII, `std::expected`,
ranges, etc.) — that is modernization, not migration, and has not started.

The 5 remaining first-party C files were converted module-by-module, each
behind its own commit, verified against the test baseline after each:
`language.c` and `lang_specs.c` (sparse array designators → IIFE-built
`std::array`), `ts_lsp.c` + `cs_lsp.c` and the three compound-literal-using
`generated/*.c` tables (`(const CBMType*[]){...}` → arena-allocated
`cbm_type_args` helper), and `hash_table.c` (verstable instantiation
compiles as C++23 unchanged — the `_Generic` macros are never expanded —
so verstable was retained with no perf change, *not* swapped for
`std::unordered_map`).

**Validation (clean from-scratch builds):** non-sanitizer **3630 pass / 0
fail**; ASan+UBSan **3629 pass / 1 fail** — the same environment-sensitive
`test_incremental` RSS-budget check that fails identically on the C
baseline.

## Current state — Phase 1 complete

* Branch: `worktree-cxx23-migration`
* Build system: **CMake** (`CMakeLists.txt` at repo root) is now the sole
  build system. `Makefile.cbm` has been **deleted**; the CI wrapper scripts
  (`scripts/{build,test,lint,security}.sh`), the pre-commit hook, the Nix
  flake, and the mingw Docker images all drive CMake. The production binary
  target (`codebase-memory-mcp`) and a `cbm-with-ui` (`-DCBM_WITH_UI=ON`)
  path are wired.
* **92 first-party `.c` → `.cpp`** ports (64 in `src/`, 28 in
  `internal/cbm/`), total ~226 LOC added vs ~10 deleted across 159
  files (extern "C" wraps + atomic shim + cast inserts + one goto-init
  fix + designator reorders).
* **Test-runner parity with C baseline:**
  * With sanitizers (mirrors `make test`): **3629 passed, 1 failed** —
    identical to the C baseline (same `test_incremental` RSS-budget
    failure, environment-sensitive, not a port regression).
  * Without sanitizers: **3630 passed, 0 failed.**

### Files Phase 1 left as C — now all ported (2026-05-29)

Phase 1 left a handful of first-party TUs as C because of C99 idioms that
don't translate mechanically. All of them have since been converted; the
table records what each needed and how it was resolved.

| File | Original blocker | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| `src/discover/language.cpp` | C99 sparse array designator `LANG_NAMES[CBM_LANG_X] = "name"` (156 entries) — GCC C++ "sorry, unimplemented" | ✅ IIFE-built function-local `std::array`; gaps stay `nullptr` → "Unknown". Folded into `cbm_discover`. |
| `internal/cbm/lang_specs.cpp` | Same sparse-array idiom (156 entries) + 3 compound literals + extern grammar decls | ✅ IIFE `std::array`; `extern "C"`-wrapped `tree_sitter_*` decls; compound literals hoisted; `(CBMLanguage)0` casts. |
| `internal/cbm/lsp/ts_lsp.cpp` | 24 `(const CBMType*[]){...}` compound literals as `cbm_type_template` args | ✅ `cbm_type_args(arena, {...})` helper copies a `std::initializer_list` into the arena. New `cbm_lsp_tscs` C++ target. |
| `internal/cbm/lsp/cs_lsp.cpp` | 3 of the same (using `ctx->arena`) | ✅ Same helper. |
| `internal/cbm/lsp/generated/*.cpp` (6 files, ~55k LOC) | Auto-generated tables; 84 compound literals (cs 81, cpp 2, c 1) | ✅ Same `cbm_type_args` helper; register fns keep C linkage via the declaring `extern "C"` lsp header. `cbm_lsp_generated` is now a C++ target. Only `gen-py-stdlib.py` exists in-tree (emits the no-compound-literal python table); other generators aren't in the repo, so these `.cpp` are the source of truth. |
| `src/foundation/hash_table.cpp` | Instantiates `verstable.h` (2069-line C99 macro lib, 26 `_Generic` sites) | ✅ Compiles as C++23 unchanged — the `_Generic` dispatch macros are never expanded (uses `cbm_vt_*` directly; overrides `HASH_FN`/`CMPR_FN`). **Verstable retained, no perf change** — *not* swapped for `std::unordered_map`. Folded into `cbm_foundation_cxx`. |

#### Vendored C → compiled as C++ (no rename; LANGUAGE CXX)

On the maintainer's "migrate ALL C to C++" directive, the vendored amalgamations
that compile + link cleanly as C++ are now built with the C++ compiler via the
`cbm_add_vendored_cxx_library` helper (CMake `LANGUAGE CXX`) — the upstream `.c`
files stay pristine and re-vendorable, just compiled as C++. Their public headers
are `extern "C"`, so the C ABI at call boundaries is preserved.

| Library | Status |
|---|---|
| mimalloc, mongoose, yyjson, lz4 | ✅ compiled as C++ (links + 3629/1 under ASan) |

#### Stays C (cannot migrate without forking generated/upstream code)

| File | Reason |
|---|---|
| `vendored/zstd/zstd.c` | Compiles as C++ but fails to LINK under sanitizers: self-declares the ASan manual-poisoning API without `extern "C"` (mangles). |
| `vendored/sqlite3/sqlite3.c` (~250k LOC) | ~788 C++ errors (void*/incomplete-type). The canonical C-only amalgamation; forking it breaks upstream updates for zero functional gain. |
| `internal/cbm/ts_runtime.c` (+ runtime amalgamation) | ~177 C++ errors (void* / designator / narrowing). Vendored tree-sitter runtime — forking diverges from upstream. |
| `internal/cbm/grammar_*.c` (154) + `vendored/grammars/**` | ~1300–1800 C++ errors each (designator order) — generated by the tree-sitter CLI; a transform would diverge them from generator output and break regeneration. The fix belongs upstream. |
| `tests/*.c` (62 files) | Test sources; call into the C++ libs via `extern "C"` headers and work as-is. |

(The last four rows are under evidence-based re-evaluation; see the migration
workflow verdicts.)

### Files now C++23

Everything else: `src/foundation/` (15 TUs), `src/cli/`,
`src/cypher/`, `src/discover/` (3 of 4), `src/graph_buffer/`,
`src/mcp/`, `src/pipeline/` (28 TUs), `src/semantic/`,
`src/simhash/`, `src/store/`, `src/traces/`, `src/ui/`,
`src/watcher/`, `src/main.cpp`, `internal/cbm/cbm.cpp`, all
`internal/cbm/extract_*.cpp`, the four cross-language LSP files
(`go_lsp.cpp`, `c_lsp.cpp`, `php_lsp.cpp`, `py_lsp.cpp`), plus
`type_rep.cpp` / `scope.cpp` / `type_registry.cpp` /
`service_patterns.cpp` / `lz4_store.cpp` / `zstd_store.cpp` /
`sqlite_writer.cpp` / `ac.cpp` / `arena.cpp` / `helpers.cpp` /
`lsp_all.cpp`.

The `lsp_all.cpp` unity blob is still compiled as a single C++ TU
that `#include`s the lsp/*.cpp files.

## What Phase 1 actually fixed across the tree

Counts come from the actual diff applied during this session.

| Category | Sites | Tool |
|---|---|---|
| `extern "C"` wraps on first-party headers | 64 headers | Python script (after-includes placement) |
| `_Atomic T x;` → `std::atomic<T> x{0};` in `.cpp` | 68 sites in 16 files | regex substitution |
| `_Thread_local` → `thread_local` | 8 sites in 6 files | regex |
| `_Static_assert` → `static_assert` | 2 sites in compat_regex.cpp | regex |
| `_Alignof` → `alignof` | 2 sites in type_rep.cpp / mcp.cpp | regex |
| `#include <stdatomic.h>` → `#include "foundation/cbm_atomic.h"` in `.cpp` | 16 files | Python |
| `CBM_TLS` macro mapped to `thread_local` in C++ mode | 1 (compat.h) | manual |
| Explicit `(T *)` cast on `malloc`/`calloc`/`realloc`/`memchr`/`memmem`/`cbm_arena_alloc`/`cbm_ht_get`/`safe_realloc`/`safe_calloc` | ~370 sites (declarations + `obj->member =` + `*deref =` forms + ternaries) | Python regex passes |
| Hoist 27 C99 compound literals `(const CBMType*[]){...}` to named locals | 24 in ts_lsp.cpp + 3 in cs_lsp.cpp — too brittle, reverted both files to .c | trial only |
| `GROW_ARRAY` macro: `(arr)->items = void*` → cast via `__typeof__((arr)->items)` | 1 in cbm.cpp, 1 in dyn_array.h | manual |
| C tests need prototype for `cbm_node_text` once ts_lsp/cs_lsp leave the unity blob | 2 (helpers.h include) | manual |
| `tree_sitter_<lang>()` forward decls wrapped in `extern "C"` (was being mangled as C++) | 5 in lsp/*.cpp | regex |
| Designated-initializer reorder to match struct decl order | 2 (mcp.cpp search_params, pass_parallel.cpp resolution) | manual |
| Anonymous-enum-in-struct → named enum (C++ scopes anonymous enums) | 1 in php_lsp.h (CBMPhpUseKind) | manual |
| `int` → typed enum casts (`{NULL, NULL, 0}` → `{NULL, NULL, (CBMLanguage)0}`) | 4 in lang_specs (now .c, moot) | manual |
| `goto cleanup` over POD init → hoist declaration above goto | 1 in pipeline.cpp | manual |
| `(CLSPContext::<unnamed struct>*)` cast → `(__typeof__(ctx->field))` | 1 in c_lsp.cpp + 1 in pass_semantic_edges.cpp | manual |
| `const char *` → `char *` literal cast | 1 in mcp.cpp (`(char *)"query execution failed"`) | manual |
| `cbm_python_stdlib_register` stub conflict when generated/*.c is a separate TU | guarded via `-DCBM_PYTHON_STDLIB_GENERATED` on `cbm_lsp_all` | CMake |

## The portable atomic shim

`src/foundation/cbm_atomic.h` provides cross-language atomic typedefs
so headers that expose atomic fields in their public ABI
(`graph_buffer.h`, `pipeline_internal.h`, `diagnostics.h`) can be
included from both C tests and C++23 libs.

```c
#ifdef __cplusplus
  #include <atomic>
  using cbm_atomic_int64 = std::atomic<int64_t>;     // and friends
  using std::atomic_int;                              // global-scope C-style names
  using std::atomic_load;                             // free-function call sites work unchanged
  using std::memory_order_relaxed;
#else
  #include <stdatomic.h>
  typedef _Atomic int64_t cbm_atomic_int64;
#endif
```

`_Atomic` storage layout matches `std::atomic` on libstdc++/glibc
(same size, same alignment), so the C tests and C++ libs see the same
struct memory layout.

## Phase 1 closing tasks (still to do)

1. ✅ **Done (partial):** the **production binary**
   (`codebase-memory-mcp`) is now wired in CMake (stub-UI `cbm` variant)
   and verified to build + run. The embedded-assets `cbm-with-ui` variant
   is still not wired.
2. ✅ **Done:** the lint pipeline (clang-tidy / cppcheck / clang-format /
   NOLINT policy) moved into `scripts/lint.sh` (cppcheck now in C++23 mode),
   and the `security` umbrella into `scripts/security.sh`. (`test-tsan` was a
   no-op in the Makefile and was dropped.)
3. ✅ **Done:** `Makefile.cbm` deleted. CI goes through the wrapper scripts
   (`scripts/{build,test,lint}.sh`), which now invoke CMake; the workflows
   call those scripts and were unchanged. `flake.nix`, `Dockerfile.mingw`,
   `docker-compose.yml`, `smoke_guard.sh`, and the pre-commit hook were
   repointed at CMake. **Locally verified on Linux** (build.sh + test.sh);
   the macOS/static-musl/mingw/Nix and `--with-ui` paths are faithful
   translations that still need a CI run to validate (clang-format/cppcheck
   were not installed in the dev env, so lint.sh is likewise CI-pending).
4. Re-enable `-Werror` on first-party C++ TUs (it's currently off for
   the C++23 side via `CBM_WERROR=OFF` to allow `-Wextra` warnings like
   enum-narrowing and format-truncation through). C side keeps
   `-Werror`.
5. Migrate `tests/*.c` to `tests/*.cpp` — only valuable if the tests
   themselves want to use C++ idioms; otherwise they work as-is.

## Phase 2 — module-by-module C → idiomatic C++23

### Phase 2 progress (safe-incremental track)

Approach (per the maintainer's call): low-risk, high-value modernizations
module by module, verified against the test suite and committed per logical
unit; perf-tuned structures (e.g. the minhash 2M-bucket LSH array) and public
ABI/signatures are left untouched unless flagged.

Done so far:
- **RAII**: minhash's per-query dedup scratch (`seen_set_t`) now owns its
  storage via `std::vector` (dropped a per-query calloc + two free()s).
- **Warning hygiene → toward `-Werror`**: a clean rebuild exposed ~54
  first-party C++ warnings latent since Phase 1. Triaged to **9 remaining**
  (all `-Wunused-function` in ts_lsp/cs_lsp, left visible as real signals):
  suppressed the benign C++20 anonymous-enum-arithmetic deprecations and
  matched the C side's `-Wno-format-truncation`/`-unused-result`/
  `-stringop-truncation` policy on the C++ flags; cast five enum-vs-size_t
  ternaries; dropped the blanket `-w` on `cbm_lsp_tscs`/`cbm_lsp_generated`
  (now warning-checked). The `cbm_lsp_all` unity blob keeps `-w` pending its
  own burn-down. `-Werror` is now within reach: the only first-party C++
  blockers are those 9 unused-function helpers and the unity blob.
- **`qsort` → `std::sort` sweep** across the clean comparator sites:
  `traces.cpp` (p99), `path_alias.cpp`, `pass_enrichment.cpp`,
  `ui/layout3d.cpp`, `graph_buffer.cpp`, `pass_parallel.cpp`, and the three
  `mcp.cpp` grep/search sorts (the last replacing a `strcmp`-cast-over-struct).
  Each predicate preserves the prior ordering key. Validated 3630/0
  (non-sanitizer) and 3629/1 (ASan+UBSan, the known RSS check only).
  Intentionally skipped: `sqlite_writer.cpp`'s parallel index-sort machinery
  (SortJob + set-once read-only context — perf-critical, marginal gain).

Remaining (not yet started): RAII of scratch allocations, `std::string` for
clear owners, `std::string_view`/`std::span` at boundaries, `std::format`
logging, cypher → ranges, concepts on the pass interface, then re-enable
`-Werror` on first-party C++ TUs.


After Phase 1, every first-party TU compiles as C++23 but the code is
still C-style. Phase 2 is the actual modernization. For each module:

1. **RAII the resources.** `malloc`/`free` → `std::unique_ptr` /
   `std::vector` / `std::string`. Replace `CBMArena` (a custom bump
   allocator) call sites with arena-aware C++ types where the arena
   semantics matter, plain stdlib types where they don't.
2. **`std::expected<T, E>` at module boundaries.** The codebase uses
   `int`/`bool` returns + out-parameters everywhere. `std::expected`
   makes the error path explicit and removes the out-param dance.
3. **`std::string_view` for non-owning slices.** Foundation already has
   `(const char *ptr, size_t len)` pair conventions; collapse them.
4. **`std::span<T>` for arrays.** Same idea, for `(T *ptr, size_t n)`.
5. **`std::format` for logging.** Replaces `snprintf` + `fprintf`
   chains.
6. **Replace `verstable` with `std::unordered_map` /
   `std::flat_map`.** Unblocks porting `hash_table.c`. Touches
   `service_patterns.cpp` and `cbm.cpp` too (they also use
   `verstable`).
7. **Replace the C99 compound-literal idiom in `ts_lsp` / `cs_lsp` /
   `language.c` / `lang_specs.c` / generated stdlib data.** Use arena
   allocations or `std::array`. Unblocks porting those files to .cpp.
8. **Lift `_Atomic` operations to `std::atomic<T>` member ops.** Free
   functions (`atomic_load(&x)`) still work via the shim, but member
   syntax (`x.load(std::memory_order_relaxed)`) is clearer.
9. **Cypher engine → ranges + views.** The `cypher.c` evaluator is a
   prime candidate for `std::ranges` adaptation.
10. **Concepts on the pipeline pass interface.** Each pass declares an
    entry function and configures itself via a struct of callbacks;
    concepts make the contract checkable.

Re-enable `-Werror` on first-party C++ TUs at the end of Phase 2.

## Open items / gotchas surfaced during Phase 1

1. **`src/foundation/vmem.c`** (now `.cpp`) — not referenced by
   `Makefile.cbm` at all, but `tests/test_vmem.c` exists. Either the
   test is dead or the Makefile is missing a build rule. Investigate
   before Phase 2.
2. **`make test-foundation` is broken upstream.** `Makefile.cbm:386-387`
   links only `FOUNDATION_SRCS`, but `tests/test_main.c` references
   every suite (`suite_security`, `suite_yaml`, etc.) and calls
   `sqlite3_shutdown()`. Either fix the target to link the full
   `PROD_SRCS` or split `test_main.c` into a foundation-only
   entrypoint. CMake's `test-runner` target sidesteps this by linking
   everything — same as `make test`.
3. **`test_incremental.c:302` memory ceiling.** Threshold is
   `< 2048 MB`; observed 2192–2327 MB under ASan+UBSan across runs in
   both baseline (C) and ported (C++23) builds. Either raise the cap,
   run the test outside sanitizers, or scope it down to a smaller
   fixture corpus. The no-sanitizer build passes it.
4. **`.note.GNU-stack` linker warning** from `code_vectors_blob.S` —
   benign; add `.section .note.GNU-stack,"",%progbits` at the end of
   the `.S` to silence.
5. **GCC 13 rejects sparse array designators** (`[ENUM_VAL] = "x"`) in
   C++ even though it accepts struct designators. This is why
   `language.c` and `lang_specs.c` stay as C.
6. **Compound-literal-inside-aggregate-initializer hoisting is brittle
   for regex.** When `(T*[]){...}` appears inside a `T returns[N] = {
   ... }` initializer list, my line-statement-aware hoist still
   misplaces declarations. The pragmatic Phase 1 call was to keep
   those two files (ts_lsp, cs_lsp) as C until Phase 2 rewrites the
   compound literals into arena allocations.
7. **Files moved out of the `lsp_all.cpp` unity blob lose any
   prototypes they were depending on through transitive include
   order.** Specifically `ts_lsp.c` and `cs_lsp.c` were using
   `cbm_node_text` without including `helpers.h`; the unity build
   made it work, the split build silently degraded to an implicit
   `int`-returning function declaration and the resulting truncation
   sign-extended the returned pointer into a SEGV during the JS
   extraction test. Now fixed with explicit `#include
   "../helpers.h"`; worth a global audit when splitting more files.

## Helpers: the scripts that did the heavy lifting

### Header `extern "C"` wrap

Places opener AFTER all `#include`/`#define` lines (including those
inside `#if` blocks) so transitively included C++ stdlib headers stay
unmangled. Putting `extern "C" {` before `#include <stdatomic.h>`
breaks because `<atomic>` templates can't have C linkage.

```python
import re, pathlib

def first_decl_line(lines, start):
    """Walk past blank lines, comments, and preprocessor directives;
    return the index of the first declaration line. Tracks #if/#endif
    nesting so the opener lands at top-level, not inside a conditional."""
    i, in_block_comment, nest = start, False, 0
    while i < len(lines):
        ln = lines[i]; s = ln.strip()
        if in_block_comment:
            if '*/' in ln: in_block_comment = False
            i += 1; continue
        if '/*' in ln and '*/' not in ln:
            in_block_comment = True; i += 1; continue
        if not s or s.startswith('//'): i += 1; continue
        if s.startswith('#'):
            kw = s[1:].lstrip().split(None, 1)[0] if s[1:].lstrip() else ''
            if kw in ('if', 'ifdef', 'ifndef'): nest += 1
            elif kw == 'endif' and nest > 0: nest -= 1
            i += 1; continue
        if nest > 0: i += 1; continue
        return i
    return len(lines)

for h in pathlib.Path('src/<module>').glob('*.h'):
    text = h.read_text()
    if 'extern "C"' in text: continue
    lines = text.split('\n')
    guard_idx = next(
        i for i, ln in enumerate(lines)
        if re.match(r'^#define\s+\w+\s*$', ln.strip())
        and i > 0
        and re.match(r'^#ifndef\s+\w+\s*$', lines[i-1].strip()))
    decl_idx = first_decl_line(lines, guard_idx + 1)
    last_endif = max(i for i, ln in enumerate(lines) if ln.strip().startswith('#endif'))
    h.write_text('\n'.join(
        lines[:decl_idx]
        + ['', '#ifdef __cplusplus', 'extern "C" {', '#endif', '']
        + lines[decl_idx:last_endif]
        + ['#ifdef __cplusplus', '}', '#endif', '']
        + lines[last_endif:]))
```

### Cast position fix when a regex-based inserter misplaces the cast

When the error log says "invalid conversion from `void*` to T*" at a
column inside the function call (e.g. `calloc(T*)(args)`), the cast
needs to move outside the call. This script catches
`IDENT(TYPE*)(args)` and rewrites to `(TYPE*)IDENT(args)` for known
void-returning allocator names only.

```python
import re, pathlib
VALID = {'malloc','calloc','realloc','safe_realloc','safe_calloc',
         'safe_malloc','cbm_ht_get','cbm_arena_alloc','cbm_arena_calloc',
         'memchr','memmem','mi_malloc','mi_calloc','mi_realloc',
         'slab_malloc','slab_calloc','slab_realloc','aligned_alloc'}
BAD = re.compile(r'\b([A-Za-z_]\w*)\(([A-Za-z_:<>][\w\s:<>*]*\*)\)\(')

for p in pathlib.Path('.').rglob('*.cpp'):
    text = p.read_text(); out = []; pos = 0
    for m in BAD.finditer(text):
        if m.group(1) not in VALID: continue
        out.append(text[pos:m.start()])
        out.append(f'({m.group(2).strip()}){m.group(1)}(')
        pos = m.end()
    out.append(text[pos:])
    p.write_text(''.join(out))
```
